# JustHome

JustHome is a project that allows tennats to learn what is in their lease in a simple, straightforward format. Tennants can upload a lease and to have it analyzed for possible illegal clauses (under Massachusetts state law) and have the main points summarized and displayed in an easy to read format. Leases can be translated from English (using google translate services) and downloaded as a txt file. Connect with local housing and legal resources on our interactive map of the Greater Boston Area. 


### To demo JustHome :
  1. go to https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/wingardl/Just-Home
  2. run "/bin/bash setup.sh" 
  3. select and upload a sample lease in PDF format
  4. see main points summarized, with option to download Spanish translation txt
 
Because this is a proof of concept, our "Your Lease"("Learn About Your Rights") page is currently for demonstration purposes only. While the summary of lease and tennat's rights were generated using our code, we have left the results of a sample lease on the page for demonstration.
